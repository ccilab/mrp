component list:
1) list order and content needs to reorganize for show or hide, so the children shows directly under its parents
2) a component can have multiple parent components and multiple child components
3) the first component - parentIds[] size is 0;
4) parentIds[] - component should only have direct relationship parent in this array
5) childIds[] - the child components should only have direct relationship to this component, and child components are expended and possibly 
   insert under its parent component when a parent component is selected
6) different component may have same child components
7) component's parentIds[] only includes its direct parent, e.g. only one parent per component (server side handles different level parents share the same children)
8) using >... to indicate there are more components 
9) fa: ellipsis-h ...
10) font size, layout unit policy - component btn, img, graphic assets in rem unit, font size in rem (in bootstrap 4), font size in em (in fontawesome),
