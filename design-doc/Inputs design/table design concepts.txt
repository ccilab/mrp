Input:
1) BOM summargy table - the output of setup BOM tree
   - the struct of each item/raw material and quantity requirements to produce a single product  
   - template base - "A Bill of Materials Template for Manufacturers.pdf"
   
2) MPS - master production schedule - from forcast or customer order - need to be configured
	- Master Production Schedule - J Beasley.pdf - repeated productions
	- The Only Master Production Schedule Guide You Will Ever Need.pdf - agile productions

3) Inventory summary for each item/raw material (Inventory Records File IRF) - need to be configured
   - Material Requirements Planning -J-Beasley.pdf

4) production operation plan - workshop/warehouse/assembly line usage planning 
   - Production Planning and Scheduling.pdf

 
MRP the process - works backward from a production plan for finished goods to develop requirements 
for components and raw materials.

The information input into MRP systems comes from three main sources: 
a bill of materials, (done)
a master production schedule , (from customer order or forecast demand, to do )
and an inventory records file. ( to do )

Output:
primary outputs:
3) production/purchase/material schedul/plan for each item - to prudece following two type of orders
   1) produce purchase order/plan for each outsource item/raw material

   2) produce products order/plan for each inhouse production item

   3) material plan

4) workshop/warehouse/assembly line usage planning 

secondary outputs:

The main outputs from MRP include three primary reports and three secondary reports. 
The primary reports consist of: 
- planned order schedules, which outline the quantity and timing of future material orders; 
- order releases, which authorize orders to be made; 
- and changes to planned orders, which might include cancellations or revisions of the quantity or time frame.

The secondary reports generated by MRP include: 
- performance control reports, which are used to track problems like missed delivery dates and stock outs in order to evaluate system performance; 
- planning reports, which can be used in forecasting future inventory requirements; 
- and exception reports, which call managers' attention to major problems like late orders or excessive scrap rates.

When tooling use is part of the inventory, the recommendations will provide visibility of calibration timescales to critical tools 
and test equipment to be used in future production.
