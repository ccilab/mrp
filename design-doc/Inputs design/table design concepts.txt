Input:
1) BOM summary table - the output of setup BOM tree ( generated from top menu )
   - the structure of each item/raw material and quantity requirements to produce a single product  
   - template base - "A Bill of Materials Template for Manufacturers.pdf"
   
2) MPS - master production schedule - a process based on cost driven to find minimum cost 
        - reference: Master Production Schedule - J Beasley.pdf 
        - input: * demand plan e.g. completed-date/demand pair - from forecast or customer order or out-going inventory setup
		 
		 * Number of employee, 
		   time/employee, 
		   cost/hour/employee, 
		   overtime/employee, 
		   overtime-cost/hour/employee,
		   time-needed/unit/employee,
		   hiring/dismissal cost/employee,
		   maximum/minimum employee allowed, 
		   Other Unit production Cost  - from product operation setup

		 * Scheduled Receipts (SR)
		   Initial Inventory or backorder ( Begining Inventory BI)
		   Maximum ending Inventory Allowed
		   Minimum ending Inventory Allowed (SS)
		   Unit Inventory holding Cost
		   Maximum purchasing (subcontracting) allowed
		   Unit subcontracting cost
		   Maximum backorder Allowed
		   Unit backorder cost - from IRF Setup
		 		 

	- The Only Master Production Schedule Guide You Will Ever Need.pdf - agile productions not cost driven

        - need to be configured and show MPS table  for both setup and monitoring	
	

3) Inventory Control - a process to find EOC (Qd) for each item/raw material (Inventory Records File IRF) 
    - input IRF
    - need to be configured and show IR table  for both setup and monitoring
    - references: 
      - choice of lot size rule -J-Beasley.pdf
      - Inventory Control -J-Beasley.pdf - decide Quantity Demanded (Qd) - Lot Size Disipline

4) production operation plan - workshop/warehouse/assembly line usage planning - need to be configured and show shift PO table for both setup and monitoring 
   - Production Planning and Scheduling.pdf
   - coordinate usage of warehouse, workshop and assembly line factory/company wide ( generated from top menu - PO summary table based on operation plans  of all shift company wide )
   - coordinate operations within a shift 

 
MRP the process - is stockout driven, not cost driven
    - works backward from a production plan for finished goods to develop requirements for components and raw materials.

The information input into MRP systems comes from three main sources: 
a bill of materials, (done)
a master production schedule , (from customer order or forecast demand, to do )
and an inventory records file. ( to do )

Output:
primary outputs:
3) production/purchase/material schedul/plan for each item - to prudece following two type of orders
   1) produce purchase order/plan for each outsource item/raw material

   2) produce products order/plan for each inhouse production item

   3) material plan

4) workshop/warehouse/assembly line usage planning 

secondary outputs:

The main outputs from MRP include three primary reports and three secondary reports. 
The primary reports consist of: 
- planned order schedules, which outline the quantity and timing of future material orders; 
- order releases, which authorize orders to be made; 
- and changes to planned orders, which might include cancellations or revisions of the quantity or time frame.

The secondary reports generated by MRP include: 
- performance control reports, which are used to track problems like missed delivery dates and stock outs in order to evaluate system performance; 
- planning reports, which can be used in forecasting future inventory requirements; 
- and exception reports, which call managers' attention to major problems like late orders or excessive scrap rates.

When tooling use is part of the inventory, the recommendations will provide visibility of calibration timescales to critical tools 
and test equipment to be used in future production.
